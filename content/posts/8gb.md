When I bought my laptop 2 years ago, I got the base model M1 MacBook Air. It was by far the fastest computer I'd ever used, a far cry from my previous Acer laptop with 2 gigabytes of ram. I used it very happily for about a year, before I watched a YouTube video titled "8gb is a scam." Apparently 8gb was not, in fact, enough for the average person, assuming that all the average person does on their laptop is consume media, do work, and check email. I program. I compile my code. I build things from source. I perform complex encryption algorithms. Everything felt completely fine, even with resource-intensive tasks on my base M1 Air.

Despite this, I couldn't help but think about whether I'd made a mistake forgoing the $200 upgrade to 16gb of ram when I bought my laptop. One part of my brain told me no, that was stupid, 8gb of ram works perfectly fine, even for power usecases. Another part told me to listen to all the people online that said 16gb was the bare minimum. It always seemed like the latter won.

So, I did what anyone would do whenever they experience inner turmoil (not really). I drew a two column chart and got to work. On the left, I wrote down all the things that were meant to convince me that 8gb of ram was, indeed, enough. I included the fact that my laptop was already a significant upgrade from my previous one, the fact that everything was perfectly smooth with my workflow, that I never opened more than 10 browser tabs at a time, that I never had more than 5 apps open at a time, that I didn't need to have that many apps and tabs open at a time anyway, etc. At the end of my session, the left column was significantly longer than the right column. It was decided, in my mind at least. 8gb was enough for my use case. People on the internet can argue about it all they want, but my opinion was set in stone.

I guess this entire story is an unintentional allegory for two things: don't blindly follow others' opinions, and be satisfied with what you have, especially when it works perfectly fine for you.
